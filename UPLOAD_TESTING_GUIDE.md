# Document Upload System Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you test the document upload functionality as different user roles. The system is implemented with a comprehensive React frontend and Firebase backend.

## Prerequisites Setup

### 1. Terminal Setup
You'll need **3 terminal windows** for testing:

**Terminal 1: Firebase Emulators**
```bash
cd /home/serge/Documents/DEVSpace/IvoireStrockTraining/backend
firebase emulators:start --only firestore,storage,auth
```

**Terminal 2: Frontend Development Server**
```bash
cd /home/serge/Documents/DEVSpace/IvoireStrockTraining/frontend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 3: Monitoring & Commands**
Keep this available for additional commands during testing.

### 2. Access Points
- **Frontend App**: http://localhost:5173
- **Firebase Emulator UI**: http://localhost:4001
- **Firestore Emulator**: http://localhost:8082
- **Storage Emulator**: http://localhost:9198
- **Auth Emulator**: http://localhost:9098

## Testing Scenarios by User Role

### Test User Creation
Before testing uploads, create test users with different roles:

1. **Attendee User**
   - Email: `attendee@test.com`
   - Password: `test123456`
   - Role: `attendee`

2. **Specialist User**
   - Email: `specialist@test.com`
   - Password: `test123456`
   - Role: `specialist`

3. **Admin User**
   - Email: `admin@test.com`
   - Password: `test123456`
   - Role: `admin`

### Role-Based Upload Testing

#### 1. Attendee User Testing (Limited Permissions)
**Expected Behavior**: Should be blocked from uploading documents

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Login with attendee credentials
3. Try to access document upload page
4. **Expected Result**: Should see "Acc√®s non autoris√©" message
5. Verify role-based UI restrictions are working

#### 2. Specialist User Testing (Standard Upload Permissions)
**Expected Behavior**: Can upload documents with standard limits

**Test Steps**:
1. Login with specialist credentials
2. Navigate to document upload page
3. **File Size Test**: Try uploading files up to 100MB (should work)
4. **File Type Test**: Test supported formats:
   - ‚úÖ PDF files
   - ‚úÖ Word documents (.doc, .docx)
   - ‚úÖ PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx)
   - ‚úÖ Images (.jpg, .png)
   - ‚úÖ Videos (.mp4, .webm)
   - ‚ùå Unsupported formats (should be rejected)

**Form Testing**:
1. **Drag-and-Drop Test**: Drag files into the upload zone
2. **Manual Selection**: Click "S√©lectionner des fichiers"
3. **Form Validation**: Test required fields:
   - Title (required)
   - Description (required)
   - Category (required)
   - Priority (required)
4. **Optional Fields**: Test tags, keywords, medical specialties
5. **Multi-file Upload**: Try uploading multiple files at once

#### 3. Admin User Testing (Full Permissions)
**Expected Behavior**: Can upload large files with all permissions

**Test Steps**:
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Test all specialist features plus:
3. **Large File Test**: Try uploading files up to 500MB
4. **All Categories**: Verify access to all document categories
5. **Admin-Only Features**: Check for any admin-specific upload options

## Common Issues to Watch For

### üêõ Potential Issues
1. **File Size Validation**: Ensure role-based limits are enforced

3. **Progress Tracking**: Verify real-time progress updates
4. **Error Messages**: Ensure French error messages are clear
5. **Storage Rules**: Confirm unauthorized access is blocked
6. **Memory Issues**: Large file uploads should not crash browser
7. **Network Errors**: Test behavior with poor connectivity

### üîç Debugging Steps

- [ ] CSRF protection is active

## Final Verification

After testing all scenarios:

1. **Check Firebase Storage**: Verify files are stored correctly
2. **Check Firestore**: Verify metadata is saved properly
3. **Check Security Rules**: Confirm unauthorized access is blocked
4. **User Experience**: Ensure the flow is intuitive for French users
5. **Error Handling**: Verify all error cases are handled gracefully

## Quick Start Commands

### Start Development Environment
